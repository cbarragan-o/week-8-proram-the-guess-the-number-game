# Logical Operators Practice #1
# Create three variables (num1, num2, and num3):

# Inside num1, store the value 36

# Inside num2, stores the result of the operation 72/2

# Inside num3, store the value 48

# Check if num1 is greater than num2, and less than num3. Store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.
  num1 = 36
  num2 = 72/2
  num3 = 48
  my_bool = num1 > num2 < num3
  print(my_bool)

# Logical Operators Practice #2
# Create three variables (num1, num2, and num3):

# Inside num1, store the value 36

# Inside num2, stores the result of the operation 72/2

# Inside num3, store the value 48

# Check if num1 is greater than num2, or less than num3. Store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.
  num4 = 36
  num5 = 72/2
  num6 = 48
  my_bool2 = num4 > num5 < num6
  print(my_bool2)
#   Logical Operators Practice #3
# Check if the words:

# word1 = "success", and

# word2 = "technology"

# are not found in the sentence below, and store the result (a boolean) in a variable called my_bool:
word1 = "success"
word2 = "technology"
# "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are against you" - Elon Musk

sentence = "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are against you"
my_bool3 = word1 not in sentence and word2 not in sentence
print(my_bool3)
